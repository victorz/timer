This is a simple timer that sleeps for the amount of time specified by
its input.

Input should be any number -- floating-point or integers -- and,
unless specified by a suffix, this will be interpreted as seconds.

The main reason for basically re-writing this simple piece of software
is that the software that exists has seconds as its minimum
granularity. I wanted at least milliseconds.
